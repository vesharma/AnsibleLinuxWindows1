/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'redhat@1'
[root@localhost ~]# /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'redhat@1'
/usr/bin/mysqladmin:
You cannot use 'password' command as mysqld runs
 with grant tables disabled (was started with --skip-grant-tables).
Use: "mysqladmin flush-privileges password '*'" instead

RESETTING THE MYSQL ROOT PASSWORD
To reset the root password for MySQL, follow these steps:

Log in to your account using SSH.

You must run the commands in the following steps as the root user. Therefore, you can either log in directly as the root user (which is not recommended for security reasons), or use the su or sudo commands to run the commands as the root user.

2. Stop the MySQL server using the appropriate command for your Linux distribution:
For CentOS and Fedora, type:
service mysqld stop
For Debian and Ubuntu, type:

service mysql stop

3. Restart the MySQL server with the —skip-grant-tables option. To do this, type the following command:

mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &

Make sure you type the ampersand (&) at the end of the command. This runs the command in the background and allows you to type the commands in the following steps.
Running MySQL with the —skip-grant-tables option enabled is highly insecure, and should only be done for a brief period while you reset the password. The steps below show you how to stop the mysqld_safe server instance safely and start the MySQL server securely after you have reset the root password.


4. Log into MySQL using the following command:

mysql

5. At the mysql> prompt, reset the password. To do this, type the following command, replacing new-password with the new root password:

UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('new-password') WHERE User='root';

6. At the mysql> prompt, type the following commands:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;

7. Stop the MySQL server using the following command. You will be prompted to enter the new MySQL root password before the MySQL server shuts down:

mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown

8. Start the MySQL server normally. To do this, type the appropriate command for your Linux distribution:

For CentOS and Fedora, type:
service mysqld start
For Debian and Ubuntu, type:

service mysql start

 To setup root password for first time, use mysqladmin command at shell prompt as follows:
$ mysqladmin -u root password NEWPASSWORD

However, if you want to change (or update) a root password, then you need to use the following command:

$ mysqladmin -u root -p'oldpassword' password newpass

mysql -u root -p'123456' -e 'show databases;'



Use mysql database (type command at mysql> prompt):
mysql> use mysql;
Change password for user nixcraft, enter:
mysql> update user set password=PASSWORD("NEWPASSWORD") where User='nixcraft';

Finally, reload the privileges:
mysql> flush privileges;
mysql> quit

Changing the MySQL root user password
To reset the password for MySQL you first must create a new file with the following contents:

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
Where PASSWORD is the new password to be used. Save that file as ~/mysql-pwd.

Next, stop the MySQL daemon with the command:

sudo systemctl stop mysql
With the daemon stopped, issue the command:

sudo mysqld -init-file=~/mysql-pwd
Once your command prompt is returned, restart the MySQL daemon with the command:

sudo systemctl start mysql
You should now be able to log into the MySQL command prompt with the new admin password like so:

mysql -u root -p
When prompted, type the admin password and you're good to go.

Recover your MySQL password
What if you've forgotten your MySQL root user password? This could be quite the predicament ... had the developers not thought of that eventuality. In order to recover the password, you simply have to follow these steps:

Stop the MySQL server process with the command sudo service mysql stop
Start the MySQL server with the command sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
Connect to the MySQL server as the root user with the command mysql -u root
At this point, you need to issue the following MySQL commands to reset the root password:

mysql> use mysql;
​mysql> update user set authentication_string=password('NEWPASSWORD') where user='root';
​mysql> flush privileges;
​mysql> quit
Where NEWPASSWORD is the new password to be used.

Restart the MySQL daemon with the command sudo service mysql restart. You should now be able to log into MySQL with the new password.
